# Projects_Python 
This my python repository.It contains all my projects which I made during my python journey.

1)TIC TAC TOE:
Beginner-intermediate level game made by using fundamental concepts of python such as def,loops and in-built python libraries such as IPython.display,random etc.
The game first ask us to choose whether we want to play with X or O and then uses numeric keys(each number is assigned to a particular postion in 3 by 3 grid just like a phone keypad) for placements of X and O.
